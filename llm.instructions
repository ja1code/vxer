- Create a typescript discord bot boiler plat

- Now I need a bot that keeps listening to all messages he receives in different text channels, whenever someone sends a x.com video link or an twitter.com video link, the bot should send the link parsed to vxtwitter

- the dev command is not working

- Now, improve the code in a way that if the user message is only the twitter/x link, delete the user's message and send a new one with "@[username that sent the message] enviou:" with the parsed link

- The deleted message replacement is not acctually pinging the user that sent the message

- Now add some rules to support tiktok, altering to vxtiktok
  @notes: I later discovered that tiktok already provides a link that works well with discord text channels. Ex: vm.tiktok.com/ZM8nY4V9/

- Is there any way to do something similar with Inistagram?
  @note: I wrote some stuff wrongly but the AI understood well everytime. When i asked for this, I didn't know if there was a service like vxtwitter that does this. Claude brought ddinstagram on its own.

- rewrite the README better describing what this repo does

- What would be a great commit message for the commit for the current state of this repo? It is the first commit
